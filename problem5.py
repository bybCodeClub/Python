 # write a program which prompts the user for a Celicus temperature then converts that number to fahrenheit


celsius = int(input("What is the temperature in Celicus? "))
convertor = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
print(f"That is {convertor} in fahrenheit ")



# Logic behind it 
# step 1 you need to have a numbe in celsius, that can be stored in a variable.  
# Then make sure that variable can take inputs and convert them into interigers (see line 4)

# Step 2: use the celsius to fahrenheit equation on the celsius variable.

# Step 3: Print the results
